# Alexicon

An epistemic governance system. It does not decide whether claims are true. It
decides what *kind* of claim each one is, and whether a move from one kind to
the next has been earned.

> **Trust is the discipline of preventing inference from becoming evidence.**

The recursive question the system exists to answer:

> *What kind of statement is this, and has it earned the right to become the
> next kind of statement?*

## What is built

**Identity Sentinel and referent resolution** — the input boundary. A name
arriving without established reference is *Entity Noise*, and nothing may be
predicated of it until it resolves.

The resolver is deterministic rather than model-backed: its purpose is to
refuse to guess, and a probabilistic resolver would reintroduce the guess it
exists to prevent. Three non-resolving outcomes, matching the framework's three
detection criteria:

| Outcome | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `ambiguous` | Attention-map dispersion — several candidates, or a surface form with non-entity senses |
| `out_of_distribution` | No match in memory |
| `unanchored` | Cognitive Passport (`Name → Subject → Role`) could not be assigned |

On any of these the Sentinel locks execution and escalates to a person. The
lock is enforced, not advisory — a claim in a locked document cannot be
classified at all, by a model or by a human. Disposing of the flag lifts it;
what is not possible is reasoning past it silently.

**Framework as data.** Domains, claim categories, and flow stages are seeded
rows scoped to a framework version, not constants. A terminology register
tracks names that have drifted, and records contested ones as `disputed`
rather than silently resolving them.

## Setup

Requires Ruby 3.4.8 and PostgreSQL 16+.

```sh
bundle install
bin/rails db:prepare   # create, migrate, seed
bundle exec rspec
bin/dev                # or bin/rails server
```

`config/database.yml` reads `PGHOST` and `PGPORT`, defaulting to
`localhost:5433`. On a standard PostgreSQL install you will want:

```sh
export PGPORT=5432
```

The non-standard default exists because this was developed on a shared machine
where port 5432 belonged to another account.
